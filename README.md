# Typing-Blitz

Description : 

Typing Blitz is a skill-testing game designed to measure typing speed and accuracy. Players are tasked with typing a paragraph within a 60-second time limit. Successfully completing the paragraph within time frame constitutes a victory. The game aims to challenge players' typing proficiency while providing an engaging and competitive experience. The main challenges of my games were how to find a way to end the game in which the player loses or wins, at first I had a clear idea but when I tried to put it into code it was difficult, which caused me to change the ending to a certain way simpler and more straightforwared
